This project is aim to achieve genome parser abilities like :- <br> 
1. It takes users genome file which they want to get parsed.<br>
2. It efficiently takes in fasta files related to genomes and parse it.<br>
3. Thereafter giving a metrics of information it did on file given to parse it.<br>
4. And then it gives option such as download a parsed file and summary csv excel file to download for user as option.<br>

<br><br>

Gparser is expert in:-<br>
1. Deduplication it removes redundancy from codons and make it easy to study.<br>
2. It removes Nitrogen base pairs from noisy genomic data efficiently.<br>
3. It gives GC content information in files and other scientific clues which are required for study.<br>
4. It gives user an array of option to customize how they want their given file to be parsed when ready like minmum codons needed,Nitrogen base pairs fractions,and deduplications all at their service.
